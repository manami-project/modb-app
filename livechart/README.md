# modb-livechart

## What does this lib do?

This lib contains downloader and converter for downloading raw data from [livechart.me](https://livechart.me) and convert it to an `Anime` object.
Don't use this lib to crawl the website entirely. Instead check whether [manami-project/anime-offline-database](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database) already offers the data that you need.
